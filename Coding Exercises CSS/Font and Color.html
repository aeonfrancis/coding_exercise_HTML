        •	Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
        •	Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
        •	Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
        •	And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;<br>
        •	Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
        •	And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;<br>
        •	And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
        •	By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;<br>
        •	But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
        •	Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;<br>
        •	Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,<br>
        •	When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:<br>
        •	So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
        •	So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
